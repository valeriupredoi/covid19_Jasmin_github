## Purpose

These are scripts in R 
that take the data 
generated by the spatial simulation 
and summarize it graphically.

## Prerequisites

[Download and install R.](https://cran.r-project.org/). 
These scripts have
been tested for R 3.4.4, 
but other versions should work as well.

You will need  the R library sp, 
but if this is missing, 
the scripts will prompt you 
to install it themselves.

## Running the scripts

If you generated data with `run_UK_100th.sh`,
you can type
```Rscript Rscripts/CompareScenarios.R```

or 

```Rscript Rscripts/PlotsSpatial.R```

More generally, the syntax is:

```Rscript  [path-to-one-of-the-scripts.R] [folder-where-the-data-is]```

If the second argument is omitted, 
it will try to pull the data 
from the current directory.
